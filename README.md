# Calvin's Website

Hi! This repo contains my open source website, based on a [template](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio) made by Ryan Fitzgerald. It uses HTML, CSS, Sass, Gulp, Font Awesome, Javascript, and a few other things that I 'self-taught' for the sake of putting this together.

Also credit to [Steve Schoger](https://www.heropatterns.com/) for the gear pattern in my Contact Me section.

The content contained on this site is updated periodically, so it may be partially out of date. The current content was made accurate on Jan 3, 2021.
